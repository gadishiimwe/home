### By coincidence, this paper was discovered in a train station on the way from New York City to Chappaqua, Westchester, New York. If thatâ€™s the case, many people are grateful.

### I hope you have a pleasant and joyous holiday season.

## Psalm 63:1-5 NIV

#### You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory. Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name, I will lift up my hands. I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips, my mouth will praise you.
